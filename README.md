# Display a List of Components

# Challenge Description
In this challenge, we display multiple instances of our `MovieItemComponent`.

## Requirements
- Inject `MoviesService` into the `AppComponent`
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Review our self-study content on dependency injection if you're stuck here
- Retrieve a Signal of all movies from that service.
- Use the @for block to repeat `MovieItemComponent` as many times as needed
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Feel free to remove any code that isn't needed anymore in your components

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- Mini.css is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles (not required)

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
